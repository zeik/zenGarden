# Zen garden on 3dprinter

## Dislaimer
Most of the code is generated with Microsoft copilot. Do not take this as good example, think it more like inspiration.

## General

This was a hackfest project to code something in Rust.

Used with FLSUN Q5 delta printer. Printer was connected via USB and serial port needs to be changed on the code.

I printer a plate, filled it with sand.

I 3d printer small head that goes ower calibration head that touches sand.

Change the Z_LEVEL based on you tool length.
